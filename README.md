# SURVIVAL
My first SDL2 game project 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* DESCRIBE
You are provided with 4 characters with different skills. Your task is to survive through 2 gates to then fight the boss. The first stage you will have to survive in the allotted time, the second stage is the scoring stage, the last stage will be to defeat the boss to win. In each stage you can pick up items to strengthen your character.

* HOW TO PLAY
    * `A` `W` `S` `D`  : move
    * `E`           : use special skill
    * `Q`           : ulti
    * `Right mouse` : normal attack
    * `F1`, `F2`      : Because the game has not completed the menu, you can use these 2 keys to switch between 2 maps
    * `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` keys on the number pad row to switch between characters
    * Every time the character runs out of health, he will die and you have to switch to another character. If all characters die or time runs out, you lose
